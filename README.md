# Action Controller in Rails

- Action Controller is the C in the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

- It processes incoming requests and generates appropriate responses.

## In a typical RESTful application:

- The controller receives the request.

- It interacts with the model to fetch or save data.

- It passes data to the view for rendering.
